function mutatedVector = nQueensMutate(parents, options, nvars, FitnessFcn, state, thisScore, thisPopulation)
% nQueensMutate, used to apply the swap mutation operator to a single
% parent to create a mutated child.
%   Picks a two indecies at random from the child, and swaps the
%   values contained within. 
%   Returns the mutated permutation

% parents ? Row vector of parents chosen by the selection function
% options ? Options structure
% nvars ? Number of variables
% FitnessFcn ? Fitness function
% state ? Structure containing information about the current generation. The State Structure describes the fields of state.
% thisScore ? Vector of scores of the current population 
% thisPopulation ? Matrix of individuals in the current population


%QUESTION: why only one parent, and why a parent at all?

    rng shuffle;
    
    %i = randi([1,2]);
    targetParent = thisPopulation{parents(1)}; % grab the parent from cell array
        
    %pick two indecies at random to swap
    indecies = randperm(targetParent,2); 

    mutatedVector = targetParent;
